# Chronometric Age Extension

The Chronometric Age extension is a standard maintained by the Chronometric Age Extension maintenance group. It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about chronometric ages and the techniques used to determine them.** by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions.
